  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -8.25782736 eV

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -56990.732467708 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -56990.732467708 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :             -1.936020106 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       92.317 MB (on task 136 after allocating wave)
          |   Maximum:       94.330 MB (on task 200 after allocating wave)
          |   Average:       93.173 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       30.838 MB (overlap_matrix on task   0)
          |   Maximum:       30.838 MB (overlap_matrix on task   0)
          |   Average:       30.838 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
